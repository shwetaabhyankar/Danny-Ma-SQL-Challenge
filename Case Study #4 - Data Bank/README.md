## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
> Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world‚Ä¶so he decides to launch a new initiative - **Data Bank**!
> 
> The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.
> 
>This case study is all about calculating metrics, growth and helping the business analyse their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 2 key datasets for this case study:
### **```region```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

This ```regions``` table contains the ```region_id``` and their respective ```region_name``` values

| "region_id" | "region_name" |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | "Australia"   |
| 2           | "America"     |
| 3           | "Africa"      |
| 4           | "Asia"        |
| 5           | "Europe"      |
</details>

### **```Customer Nodes```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

Customers are randomly distributed across the nodes according to their region - this also specifies exactly which node contains both their cash and data.
This random distribution changes frequently to reduce the risk of hackers getting into Data Bank‚Äôs system and stealing customer‚Äôs money and data!
Below is a sample of the top 10 rows of the ```data_bank.customer_nodes```

| "customer_id" | "region_id" | "node_id" | "start_date" | "end_date"   |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| 1             | 3           | 4         | "2020-01-02" | "2020-01-03" |

### **Q1. How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT node_id) AS node_counts
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;
```

| "node_count" |
|--------------|
| 5            |

### **Q2. What is the number of nodes per region?**

```sql
SELECT
	regions.region_name,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_nodes.node_id) AS node_counts
FROM data_bank.regions
INNER JOIN data_bank.customer_nodes
ON regions.region_id = customer_nodes.region_id
GROUP BY regions.region_name;
```

| "region_name" | "node_counts" |
|---------------|---------------|
| "Africa"      | 5             |
| "America"     | 5             |

### **Q3. How many customers are allocated to each region?**

```sql
SELECT
	regions.region_name,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_nodes.customer_id) AS customer_counts
FROM data_bank.regions
INNER JOIN data_bank.customer_nodes
ON regions.region_id = customer_nodes.region_id
GROUP BY regions.region_name;
```

| "region_name" | "customer_counts" |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Africa"      | 102               |

WITH cte_deposit AS (
	SELECT 
		customer_id,

	FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
	WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
	GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
	AVG(deposit_count) AS avg_deposit_count,
	AVG(deposit_amount) AS avg_deposit_amount
FROM cte_deposit;

```SQL
WITH cte_customer AS (
	SELECT
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date) AS month_part,
		TO_CHAR(txn_date, 'Month') AS month,
		customer_id,
		SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS deposit_count,
		SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count,
		SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS withdrawal_count
	FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
	GROUP BY
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM txn_date),
		TO_CHAR(txn_date, 'Month'),
		customer_id
)
SELECT 
	month,
	COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM cte_customer
WHERE deposit_count > 1 AND (purchase_count >= 1 OR withdrawal_count >= 1)
GROUP BY 
	month_part,
	month
ORDER BY month_part;
```

| "month"     | "customer_count" |
|-------------|------------------|
| "January  " | 168              |
| "February " | 181              |
